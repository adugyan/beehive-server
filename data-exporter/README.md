## Installing dependencies

```sh
# Expects Python 3, so you may need pip3 install ...
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Example Usage

### Export Datasets from 2018-05-10

The following would export all datasets from 2018-05-10 to `mydatasets` as a
`mydatasets/nodeid/date.csv` tree.

```
./list-datasets | grep 2018-05-10 | ./export-datasets mydatasets
```

The you could grep the tree using something like:

```
grep -h -r 'failures,nc' mydatasets
```

### Working Remote

You can access the Cassandra database remotely opening an SSH tunnel in the
background.

```
ssh beehive1 -L 9042:localhost:9042
```

This allows you to remotely run exporting commands for testing, backups, etc.
