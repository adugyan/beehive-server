## Sections

The following items are available here. If you're unsure where to start, you most likely want the Complete Project Digest.

* [Complete Project Digest](digest-aot-chicago.tar.gz) - Contains latest aggregate of all sensor data from this project, along with node and sensor metadata. Details are available in the [README](https://github.com/waggle-sensor/beehive-server/blob/master/publishing-tools/docs/digest-readme.md).

* [Per Node Data Digest](nodedata.tar.gz) - Contains just the sensor data from Complete Project Digest, split into file-per-node.

* [Project Metadata](metadata.tar.gz) - Contains just the metadata from Complete Project Digest.
