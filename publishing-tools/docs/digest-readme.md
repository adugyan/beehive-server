# Project Digest Readme

The files in this directory contain sensor data and the associated meta-data that
will enable parsing the sensor values.

## Overview

This sensor data digest contains the following files:

* `data.csv` - Sensor data.
* `nodes.csv` - Nodes metadata.
* `sensors.csv` - Sensor metadata.
* `provenance.csv` - Provenance metadata.

These files will be described in-depth in the following sections.

### Sensor Data

The sensor data file is an aggregate of all published data from the project's
nodes. By published, we mean:

* Data was read from a whitelisted node belonging to the project.
* Data was read during that node's commissioning period.
* Data was read from a whitelisted sensor.
* Data value passed a simple range check - the value for the parameter is reasonable and within the possible values the sensor can generate. No further checks were made on the data.

The `data.csv` file is a CSV with the following, but not limited to, columns:

* `timestamp` - UTC timestamp of when the measurement was done.
* `node_id` - ID of node which did the measurement.
* `subsystem` - Subsystem of node containing sensor.
* `sensor` - Sensor that was measured.
* `parameter` - Sensor parameter that was measured.
* `value_raw` - Raw measurement value from sensor.
* `value_hrf` - Converted, "human readable" value from sensor.

These fields will always be provided as a header, for example:
```
timestamp,node_id,subsystem,sensor,parameter,value_raw,value_hrf
2017/09/09 22:12:44,001e0610ba8f,lightsense,hih4030,humidity,NA,32.18

2017/09/09 22:12:44,001e0610ba8f,metsense,metsense,id,00001814B7E8,00001814B7E8
2017/09/09 22:12:44,001e0610ba8f,metsense,pr103j2,temperature,839,NA
```

Additional information such each node's coordinates or each sensor units can be found
in the metadata. More information about these will be provided in the next two sections.

A sensor values may be marked `NA`, indicating that either the raw or HRF value is
unavailable.

*Note: Currently, we _do not_ do automatic in-depth or cross sensor comparison and
filtering. For example, a damaged sensor _could_ repeat an error value over and over if it is
in the accepted range or a node _could_ have a sensor value deviate from its neighbors.*

### Node Metadata

The node metadata provides additional information about each of a project's nodes. This
file is a CSV with the following fields:

* `node_id` - ID of node.
* `project_id` - ID of project which manages node.
* `vsn` - Public name for node. The VSN is visible on the physical enclosure.
* `address` - Street address of node.
* `lat` - Latitude of node.
* `lon` - Longitude of node.
* `description` - More detailed description of node's build and configuration.

These fields will always be provided as a header, for example:
```
node_id,project_id,vsn,address,lat,lon,description
001e0610bc10,AoT Chicago,01F," State St & 87th Chicago IL",41.736314,-87.624179,AoT Chicago (S) [C]
001e0610ba8b,AoT Chicago,018," Stony Island Ave & 63rd St Chicago IL",41.7806,-87.586456,AoT Chicago (S) [C]
001e0610ba18,AoT Chicago,01D," Damen Ave & Cermak Chicago IL",41.852179,-87.675825,AoT Chicago (S)
001e0610ba81,AoT Chicago,040," Lake Shore Drive & 85th St Chicago IL",41.741148,-87.54045,AoT Chicago (S)
001e0610ba16,AoT Chicago,010," Ohio St & Grand Ave Chicago IL",41.891964,-87.611603,AoT Chicago (S) [C]
```

Additional details about a node are contained in the description field. The letters
inside the brackets `[ ]` indicate:

* `C` - Node is equipped with chemical sensors.
* `A` - Node is equipped with Alphasense OPN-N2 air quality sensor.
* `P` - Node is equipped with Plantower PMS7003 air quality sensor.

### Sensor Metadata

The sensor metadata provides additional information about each of the sensors published
by the project. This file is a CSV with the following fields:

* `ontology` - Sensor name.
* `subsystem` - Subsystem containing sensor.
* `sensor` - Sensor name.
* `parameter` - Sensor parameter.
* `unit` - Physical units of sensor value.
* `minval` - Minimum value according to datasheet. Used as lower bound in range filter.
* `maxval` - Maximum value according to datasheet. Used as upper bound in range filter.
* `datasheet` - Reference to sensor's datasheet.

These fields will always be provided as a header, for example:
```
ontology,subsystem,sensor,parameter,hrf_unit,hrf_minval,hrf_maxval,datasheet
/sensing/meteorology/pressure,metsense,bmp180,pressure,hPa,300,1100,"https://github.com/waggle-sensor/sensors/blob/master/sensors/airsense/bmp180.pdf"

/sensing/meteorology/humidity,metsense,hih4030,humidity,RH,0,100,"https://github.com/waggle-sensor/sensors/blob/master/sensors/airsense/htu4030.pdf"
/sensing/meteorology/humidity,metsense,htu21d,humidity,RH,0,100,"https://github.com/waggle-sensor/sensors/blob/master/sensors/airsense/htu21d.pdf"
/sensing/meteorology/temperature,metsense,htu21d,temperature,C,-40,125,"https://github.com/waggle-sensor/sensors/blob/master/sensors/airsense/htu21d.pdf"
```

### Provenance Metadata

The provenance metadata provides additional information about the origin of this
project digest. This file is a CSV with the following fields:

* `data_format_version` - Data format version.
* `project_id` - Project ID.
* `data_start_date` - Minimum possible publishing UTC timestamp.
* `data_end_date` - Maximum possible publishing UTC timestamp. If no explicit date exists, the creation date is used.
* `creation_date` - UTC timestamp this digest was created.
* `url` - URL where this digest was provided.

These fields will always be provide as a header, for example:
```
data_format_version,project_id,data_start_date,data_end_date,creation_date,url
1,AoT_Chicago.complete,2017/03/31 00:00:00,2018/04/10 15:34:36,2018/04/10 15:34:36,http://www.mcs.anl.gov/research/projects/waggle/downloads/datasets/AoT_Chicago.complete.latest.tar.gz
```

## Disclaimer

Although our goal is to provide stable metadata files, please consider these as
in-development. If you do write tools which process them, we *strongly* recommend
taking advantage of the metadata headers in order to accommodate future changes.
