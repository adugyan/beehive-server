# Data Digest

## Overview

This digest contains the following data files:

* Sensor Data - `data.csv`
* Node Metadata - `metadata/nodes.csv`
* Sensor Metadata - `metadata/sensors.csv`

These files are described in-depth in the following sections.

### Sensor Data - `data.csv`

`data.csv` is an aggregate of all _published_ data from a project's nodes.
By published, we mean:

* Data was read from whitelisted node.
* Data was read during node's commissioning time.
* Data was read from whitelisted sensor.
* Data passes simple range check.

*Note: We do not do automatic, detailed sensor filtering. For example, a damaged sensor _could_ produce values in an accepted range, but repeat the same default value over and over.*

`data.csv` follows a CSV format with the following fields:

* `node_id` - ID of node which produced the reading.
* `timestamp` - UTC timestamp when reading was produced.
* `plugin` - Plugin which produced reading.
* `sensor` - Sensor which produced reading.
* `parameter` - Specific parameter from sensor.
* `value` - Reading value.

For example:
```
node_id,timestamp,plugin,sensor,parameter,value

```

More information about nodes and sensors is discussed in the next two sections.
